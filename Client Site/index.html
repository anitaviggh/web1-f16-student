                    <p>Hello, my name is Carolyn Viggh. I am a personal trainer, nutritionist, and health and wellness coach. My mission is to help you bring balance to your life and be a healthier, happier you. It is my hope that through my coaching services and my writing, you find the tools and information you need to take the best possible care of yourself.</p>
                    <p>I believe that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to wellness - no single nutrition or workout plan that will magically fix all of your problems. Because of this, the services I provide to each of my clients are unique. Through my individualized approach, I help my client improve their health, manage their weight, and escape the "diet culture" that holds so many of us back in our quest for health and happiness.</p>

                    <h3>Wellness Consultation</h3>
                    <p>A wellness consultation is a single meeting either over the phone or on skype. In this meeting we will explore your goals, identify the areas of wellness you struggle with the most, and discuss potential changes that could help you align your goals, values, and actions to create a life of health and happiness.</p>
