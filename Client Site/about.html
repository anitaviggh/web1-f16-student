                    <h2>What is Wellness Coaching?</h2>
                    <p>We live in a world that makes it really hard to take care of ourselves. Sometimes it seems like everything from the grocery store to social media is out to make it harder to live the happy, healthy lives we want to. Luckily, I am here to help through my wellness coaching services.</p>
                    
                    <p>Wellness coaching is not a program. It is not a diet or a workout plan or a set of steps. It is one-on-one assistance to get you to where you want to be in body, mind, and life. As one of my coaching clients, you will receive individualized service designed to help you where you need it most. Whether you struggle with your weight, can't seem to find time to exercise, or are simply unhappy with the state of your health and happiness, I am here to guide you. </p>

                    <p>Essentially, I help my clients develop a set of self-care tools that allow them to have a healthy, well-functioning body and balanced mindset.</p>
                    
                    <p>I coach clients in:</p>

                    </ul>
