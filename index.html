        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://2016.fromthefront.it/">The Frontend Guide to Life, The Universe and Everything:</a> This is a website that looks unique and visually interesting without relying on animations or other things which increase load time too much. The colors and style of the illustrations are fun and engaging, and all of the type is legible.</li>
            <li><a href="http://toscomusic.org/">Tosco Music:</a> The typography is fun and effective, and the animations are interesting without being overly disruptive. It makes very good use of a sidebar.</li>
            <li><a href="http://outlines.pt/?lang=en">Outlines:</a> The duotone caught my eye immediately, and it's dark enough that the navigation menu text is legible. The ui elements, typefaces, and icons also feel very cohesive throughout.</li>
            <li><a href="https://artsandculture.withgoogle.com/en-us/">The Hidden Worlds of the National Parks:</a> It's an engaging, beautiful, and easy to navigate interactive experience. It also has good accessability features like optional subtitles. </li>
            <li><a href="http://www.kikk.be/2016/">Kikk Festival:</a> The experimental typography and layout of this site caught my attention. I especially love the subtle glitching effects on the type and images.</li>

        <h2>Why I'm Taking This Class</h2>
        <p>
            I've been interested in web design for years, and I hope to specialize in it as a career. While I do have coding experience, I am primarily self-taught, so there's a good chance I've picked up on some bad habits, especially with responsive design and accessability. In addition, I'm not great at making my websites look good, so this class will be good practice. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In this class I hope to achieve more accessable and aesthetically pleasing websites. I am already comfortable with HTMl and CSS, but I am excited to learn more about javascript.
