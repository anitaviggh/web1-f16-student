    <h2>Why I'm Taking This Class</h2>
	<p>
		I've been interested in web design for years, and I hope to specialize in it as a career. While I do have coding experience, I am primarily self-taught, so there's a good chance I've picked up on some bad habits, especially with responsive design and accessability. In addition, I'm not great at making my websites look good, so this class will be good practice. 
	</p>
    <p>
		In this class I hope to achieve more accessable and aesthetically pleasing websites. I am already comfortable with HTMl and CSS, but I am excited to learn more about javascript.
