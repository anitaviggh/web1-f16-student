                        <h2>Packing Light</h2>
                        <h3>First Steps Into Minimalism</h3><br/>
                        <p>I am in a time of continuous change. In the last three months I graduated college, moved to a new state, and started a new job. And just as I am feeling like I am starting to settle in, I am faced with new expenses, responsibilities at work ramp up, and another move to another new apartment is just a few weeks on the horizon.</p><p>I love it, but it is a lot. Too much maybe.</p><p>Recently I have been feeling like I need to lighten the load. In a life where I need to be constantly adapting and cannot rely on too much regularity, too many things getting in the way will inevitably just drive me off the rails. I have a tendency to overcommit, overwork, and overthink myself into fatigue. So, I have decided to eliminate some of these road blocks by literally getting rid of a lot of my stuff. My hope is that with less physical things cluttering my space, I will be able to navigate my dynamic life with more ease.</p><p>I am not new to the idea of dramatic decluttering sprees. I even went through the entire&nbsp;Konmari&nbsp;process about a year ago.&nbsp;But with my recent shift in perspective and sudden disgust towards most of my stuff, I am feeling the desire to take the plunge into full-on minimalism.</p><p>Of course, I made this decision while my co-habitating boyfriend was on vacation and about 12 hours before leaving for a weekend trip to visit my family. Not exactly the most opportune time to take on a stuff-purging endeavor. But I still wanted to start, so when I packed my bag the next morning, I treated it as my first practice in minimalism.</p><p>Now, in all honesty, I had no idea what I was doing. At the time I had yet to read a book or even a blog post about minimalism. I had, however watched a YouTube video of a girl showing her viewers the ~10 items of clothing she owned. That was enough for me. With little guidance and a lot of excitement, I attempted to pack as lightly as possible. This is what I brought:</p>
                        <img src="images/minimalism.png">
                        <p>Starting from the top right: Laptop, workout pants, workout shirt, sports bra, cardigan, tee-shirt, shorts, book, journal, eyeliner, eyebrow pencil, sleep shirt, sneakers, underwear, socks, epipens, wallet, toothbrush, laptop charger, headphones, retainer, foundation/concealer, eyelash curler, lip balm, powder, powder brush, purse, make-up bag, hair brush, dry shampoo. (Not pictured: driving outfit because I was wearing it, cell phone because it's taking the picture, and cell phone and sunglasses because they were already in my car.)</p><p>All of this fit in one canvas bag.</p><p>This is 31 individual items. 9 items of clothing, 11 make-up and hygiene products, 1 pair of shoes and 8 miscellaneous items.</p><p>This is what I packed for two days and one night at my parent's house. I knew I would be going out for a meal and attending a Crossfit class (more on that experience in another post). I only brought clothes for those events. I tried to only bring the very basics for make-up.</p><p>This is a LOT less stuff than I usually bring for an overnight trip. In fact, I sometimes bring more stuff with me to work.</p><p>I was raised by a very over-prepared father.&nbsp;Packing for a family day-trip to the beach looked more like we were ready for a month long road trip across the country.&nbsp;One time the five of us drove to Ohio in one car. I don't know how we managed.</p><p>I was taught to prepare for any possible situation: Various weather conditions, supplies for emergencies, extra clothes in case of spills and accidents. I only recently came to realize how this preparedness trained me to be anxious about everything that could go wrong. But it also taught me what I really needed, and what can be left behind because I almost never need to use it.</p><p>Luckily, I was visiting a house full of all of the materials I would need to tackle any situation. First aide supplies, extra clothes and towels, and laundry equipment are all abundant in the Viggh household. With this safety net in mind I was able to pack with relative calm.</p><p>So, how did it go? Did&nbsp;I have everything I needed?</p><p>Yes! In fact, I did not even wearing the extra outfit I brought. The comfy dress I wore for driving ended up being my outfit for both days.</p><p>I really did feel "lighter" bringing less stuff. I also felt more present - like I was able to more fully enjoy time with my family and the activities we did because I only brought myself and not all of my&nbsp;(literal and figurative) baggage.</p><p>After this experiment, I am even more excited enter into a more minimalistic way of living. But, I don't really know what I am doing, and I want to make sure I am being thoughtful about this process. My next step is to read through The Minimalists' 21 Day Journey. I may follow it exactly, but I may not. Either way I want to do this with a strategy, and educating myself about this lifestyle is the first thing I need to do to develop one.</p><p>Wish me luck!</p>
