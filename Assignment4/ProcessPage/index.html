        <h2>Competitive Audit</h2>
        <p><a href="http://wellfitstudio.com/">WellFit Studio</a></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pros: On most pages, the typography and use of color are spot on for what my client is looking for. Subtle scroll animations add some polish to the homepage. The two column layout works well.</li>
            <li>Cons: Layout is slightly inconsistant across pages, especially the header. The typography and layout get a bit awkward and sometimes fall apart completely on interior pages. The sticky nav bar is too tall.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><a href="http://www.josefrakichfitness.com/">Josef Rakich Fitness</a></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pros: The typography and colors are well implimented. The header on the home page in clean without being boring, and I could take inspiration from it. Start selling the product right on the homepage. The articles section is an interesting take on how to do a blog.</li>
            <li>Cons: This person's fitness philosophy is very, very different from Carolyn's (her focus is more on health than body image), so the transformation pictures likely won't be useful.</li>
        </ul>
