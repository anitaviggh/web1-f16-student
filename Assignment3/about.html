            <h3>About Angelarium</h3>
            <p>Back in 2005, I discovered that there were thousands of named angels throughout multiple mythologies. I've been hooked ever since and Angelarium has been a part of my life every single day. Even when I'm not paying attention to it, it's gone out on the internet and had a life of its own. The name of the project has come to define the idea of surreal angelic figures and the fan base around it has inspired me to continue to create new designs for it.</p>
